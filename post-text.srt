psychological 9407 wrote for returning a birthday gift I got for my boyfriend after he insulted me about my colourful past

2
00:00:08,735 --> 00:00:13,917
this happened last night but my phone is still blowing up I have 26

3
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:20,440
dipped into my savings and got Mike my boyfriend 27 A PS5 for his birthday yesterday

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,776
he knew he was getting the PS5 because he told me that the PS5 is the only thing he wants

5
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:32,361
we've been together for 4 years so the cost didn't matter that is until I found out what he thinks about me

6
00:00:32,361 --> 00:00:38,269
some background when I was 18 I was involved with Jake a guy who I met online

7
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:43,976
we ended things after 3 months and I moved on shortly after without him a guy from work

8
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:52,432
I found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didn't know Jake long enough to meet his friend group so I had no idea

9
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:58,530
after finding out I took some time off dating in two years later I met my current boyfriend Mike

10
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,960
I was upfront and honest with Mike about my past in the fact that I was unintentionally involved with friends

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:12,481
he said he understood in my past didn't bother him last night at his party I showed up with a PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy

12
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:17,828
is best female friend Jessica laughed and said I wish I was a thought so I could afford a ps52

13
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:23,603
I looked at her with an excuse me look on my face and she just said nevermind and walked away

14
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:29,750
I confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote she's just messing with you you can't take a joke

15
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:37,240
so I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said well everyone knows you were thought before you met me

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,460
I asked him to explain how I was a thought before him and he said you know messing with best friends

17
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:51,197
didn't put me on the shoulder and said that it's okay because I'm not who I was back then and if he could get over my colourful past and thought mentalities to give me a chance

18
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:56,213
then I could get over Jessica's comments and give her another chance I didn't say anything

19
00:01:56,213 --> 00:02:01,442
I just got up took the PS5 from the gift table and left

20
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:10,408
pissed he literally called me like 20 times but I didn't care I was so hurt that I took the Bell off and took it straight back to the store I got it from

21
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:20,261
they heavily refunded it I thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica arbitrating me for being petty and they're all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices

22
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:27,681
I responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasn't a thought and get the PS5 from them because I returned it

23
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:33,389
he started screaming how I'm the biggest off for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my colourful past

24
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm thinking maybe taking it back went too far am I the a-hole sweet potato famished Road

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,189
I'm so confused but maybe that's because I'm an old lady who got married around the time you were in kindergarten

26
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:52,698
if anyone was wrong in the Jake's Ottomans and it was Adam you might have dated friend

27
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:58,674
but he dated his best friend's ex that's on them to figure out an atom's mistake only

28
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:04,055
to where I come from dating three dudes and 7 years does not a colourful past make

29
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:09,154
did Hulk get a new definition since the early 00s not the a-hole

30
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:15,709
and I hope you do something special for yourself with a little of that money you got back from returning the gift you got your ex-boyfriend

31
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:21,275
190 pairs of panties Road and ta give him the keys to the curb

32

00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,440
 What was your, they're not gonna last long moment.

 N. Lessoson wrote bride was such a monumental bitch.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,260
 Her mom gave me a $500 tip for not walking out on the event

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,540
 when she was treating everyone,

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,340
 even her now husband like a piece of shit employee.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,820
 She did the whole clicking fingers thing

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,820
 when wanting someone to do something for her.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,620
 And she berated the G for grabbing a sandwich

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,100
 when he'd been there for about eight hours

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,940
 and was told that he should have brought his own lunch

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,620
 and she would be taking the cost of the food

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,880
 like an open office style out of his paycheck.

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,640
 They were divorced within three years,

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,480
 but not before having three kids that have stupid names.

 Girl Abides wrote when the groom looked at her

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,760
 like she was the love of his life

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,800
 and she treated the day like her prom and ignored him.

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,840
 I think they lasted six months.

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,560
 Sebastian Flights wrote when I worked as a wedding planner

21
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,440
 for a hotel chain, the groom had found out his bride

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,820
 was having an affair with her brother's best mate.

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,440
 The bride's mother knew about it,

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,760
 but insisted on the wedding and paid a fortune.

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,040
 The groom wasn't drinking much and at the speeches,

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,360
 stood up and revealed he knew

27
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,120
 and said he was getting an annulment.

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,840
 He then took his best man on his honeymoon,

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,240
 the honeymoon the bride's Karen's had paid for.

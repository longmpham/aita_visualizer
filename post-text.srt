00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,697
roditis Metzger road am I the a-hole for telling my sister grieving her dog is not the same as me grieving my husband

2
00:00:06,697 --> 00:00:14,281
to make a long story short I lost my husband only a month ago it's hard I'm still breathing and I miss him every day

3
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:23,756
I have to take medication for depression and anxiety to help me get through the day last week my sister's dog was put down due to some health issues and she was very upset

4
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:30,145
which is understandable she called me as soon as it happened and said I was the only sibling who would understand her pain

5
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:35,234
I didn't mind honestly I just wanted to comfort her since her dog meant the world to her

6
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:42,768
she held awake for him in our whole family attended it was a nice service but now she's comparing our losses

7
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:49,438
telling me she knows exactly what I'm going through that she can relate to the pain of losing someone so close to you

8
00:00:49,438 --> 00:00:55,367
she called me asking if we should visit Graves together it was fine the first time but it's constant

9
00:00:55,367 --> 00:01:01,082
she goes three times a day it's already difficult to go once a week for me and she knows this

10
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:09,582
I feel like she's not even considering my own grief process anyway I told her that grieving her dog is not the same as grieving my husband

11
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:14,931
she's upsetting refusing to talk to me now I get it it was uncalled for really

12
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:20,392
but my loss is new to me too and I guess I just got frustrated with how different we're dealing with our losses

13
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:26,284
if I feel like she should understand where I'm coming from to a dog is not the same as a husband

14
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:32,574
a dog can't love you back like a husband can a dog can redo your children like a husband can

15
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:40,394
a dog can't make soup when you're like a husband can it's really hard for me right now to discern when I'm being condescending or not

16
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:45,600
if it's a side effect of my medication or if the empathetic part of my brain has shut down

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,760
but I really am getting tired of her comparing are paying when she lost her dog and I lost my world

18
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:59,094
at the very least she still has her husband I have two young children at home processing a loss unimaginable to most kids their age

19
00:01:59,094 --> 00:02:08,641
and she's trying to whisk me away to graveyards to visit her dog Ida update there seems to be mixed opinions on this thread which is fine

20
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:16,105
I guess people have different views on what assholes behaviour is first of all I appreciate all of your condolences

21
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:21,276
there are just simply too many to like and respond to although I think I got to upload most of them

22
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:26,288
then I have decided to add it to an update this garnered far more attention than I expected

23
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:32,697
in all honesty I thought the first few comments were enough some of these comments did cheer me up

24
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:39,765
there was a whole atomology lesson in here at some point face with tears of joy secondly I know where I went wrong

25
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:44,815
it's the whole reason for the Post after all and I can see where my sister went wrong

26
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:49,947
I will have an honest conversation with her at some point and we have spoken since the incident

27
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:56,240
but it was mostly to do with our mothers birthday I think we're both just in a place where the wounds are too fresh

28
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:05,040
it doesn't help that as a big sister I am normally always her Rock but this time I was more like a deflated balloon dealing with so many other things on my mind

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,832
it's been a roller-coaster this past month and I think the graveyard visits were possibly more triggering than I realized at the time

30
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:24,222
I did want to be there for her initially but it was just too much it was never my intention to minimize anyone's pain of losing a pet I went through a moment of selfishness where I thought she could not possibly understand my pain

31
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:32,348
I know losing a pet is a painful process for many people I'm not really a pet person so I guess that's where my lack of understanding comes from

32
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:38,536
but at the time I did not think of it as insulting because I did not mean to imply she shouldn't feel grief over a pet

33
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:43,780
I amended as she couldn't understand the continuous effects of losing your partner and co-parent

34
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,901
something new always pops up that he would normally deal with a plumbing issue having to fix some shelves

35
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:59,583
the kids wanting to have a barbecue I like in so many things he could easily sort out and it makes me feel like a horrible parent and wife like I was burning him with so much

36
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:07,083
I plan to explain all of this to her I think she'll understand we've been through worse and we've made it out fine

37
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:14,838
I have faith that our relationship will only become stronger from this I love her and as much as I am her Rock She's Mine

38
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:20,368
but in this one particular instance perhaps it's safer for our relationship that we keep a distance

39
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:27,805
we're just too different when we grieve it's not compatible but that doesn't mean I don't care about what she's going through

I am not going to be too mean to your sister but she is being an a-hole here

42
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:51,696
not just because dogs live shorter lives than humans so it is more expected not just that no matter how much we love animals humans and GT other animals but also because you can't necessarily compare grief in the first place

43
00:04:51,696 --> 00:04:56,889
some people are comforted by sharing similar experiences some people find it pushy

44
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:04,121
and if you start doing that any other person doesn't like it you stop asleep underscore Dimension underscore 120 Road

45
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:12,067
not the a-hole she lost a dog while she cared for her pet it was just that a pet lossing a dog doesn't leave you worrying about paying the mortgage

46
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:18,716
how to care for your children Etc yes she has grief but people need to stop comparing animals with humans

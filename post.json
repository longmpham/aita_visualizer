    "selftext": "I 29 female am pregnant with my boyfriend Sam 32. Sam and I went to a party for his family. No momentous occasional just a normal family get together. During my pregnancy I have had intense cravings. \n\nWhile we were at the party I told Sam I was craving a slushee. About 30 minutes away. We had just arrived about 20 minutes prior. He said to give him a little while and we\u2019d go get one. \n\nAfter about 30 more minutes I said it again to Sam. He said fine get in the car. On our way there we got into an argument and he thinks the craving could have waited a couple hours. He\u2019s now mad at me we have to leave the party early. We see his family 2-3 times a month sometimes more and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal to leave when I have a craving. \n\nAITA?",

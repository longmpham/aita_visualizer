    "title": "Am I the A-Hole for returning a birthday gift I got for my boyfriend after he insulted me about my colorful past?",
    "selftext": "This happened last night but my phone is still blowing up. I F(26) dipped into my savings and got Mike, my boyfriend (27) a PS5 for his birthday yesterday. He knew he was getting the PS5 because he told me that the PS5 is the only thing he wants. Weve been together for 4 years so the cost didnt matter. That is until, I found out what he thinks about me. Some background: When I was 18, I was involved with Jake, a guy who I met online. We ended things after 3 months, and I moved on shortly after with Adam, a guy from work. I found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didnt know Jake long enough to meet his friend group, so I had no idea. After finding out, I took some time off dating and two years later, I met my current boyfriend Mike. I was upfront and honest with Mike about my past and the fact that I was unintentionally involved with friends. He said he understood and my past didnt bother him. Last night at his party, I showed up with the PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy. His best female friend Jessica laughed and said I wish I was a thot so I could afford a PS5 too. I looked at her with an excuse me? Look on my face and she just said nevermind and walked away. I confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote shes just messing with you. You cant take a joke? So I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said well, everyone knows you were a thot before you met me. I asked him to explain how I was a thot before him and he said you know...messing with best friends? He then pat me on the shoulder and said that its okay because Im not who I was back then and if he could get over my colourful past and thot mentalities to give me a chance, then I could get over Jessicas comments and give her another chance. I didnt say anything. I just got up. Took the PS5 from the gift table and left. He was PISSED. He literally called me like 20 times, but I didnt care. I was so hurt that I took the bow off and took it straight back to the store I got it from. They happily refunded it. I thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica are berating me for being petty and theyre all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices. I responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasnt a thot and get the PS5 from them because I returned it. He started screaming how Im the biggest AH for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my colourful past. Im thinking maybe taking it back went too far. Am I The A-Hole?",

But maybe thats because Im an old lady who got married around the time you were in Kindergarten. \\n\\nA) if anyone was wrong in the Jake/Adam incident it was Adam. You might have dated friends, but he dated his best friends ex. Thats on them to figure out, and Adams mistake only.\\n\\n2) Where I come from, dating 3 dudes in 7 years does not a colorful past make. Did ho get a new definition since the early 00s? \\n\\nNot the A-Hole\\n\\nAnd I hope you do something special for yourself with a little of that money you got back from returning that gift you got your ex boyfriend.'}, {'author': '190PairsOfPanties', 'comment': \"NTA.

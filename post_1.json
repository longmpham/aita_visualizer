With 14 grandkids, a lot of food was bought to get there. Her cats didn't complain though lol. Still sleep with it, it's a feeling of comfort, safety and home",

She had Sealo for a couple of years before she passed away.  I hug Seal-o every night and pray to my wife, tell her about my day, things coming up, etc.  I'll start using her perfume on Sealo soon, so I can smell her while I pray to her.  My heart can't take it right now.",

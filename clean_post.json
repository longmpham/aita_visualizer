    "selftext": "I 36 female have been married to my husband Josh 40 for 10 years. We have a 9 year old daughter Lauren together and my step daughter Riley is 18. \n\nAbout a year ago I booked a vacation with my girlfriends for one of their bachelorette parties. It\u2019s this weekend in Tennessee. We leave Thursday and come back Monday. \n\nThis weekend Lauren has a cheerleading competition that Josh is taking her to. Lauren is required to have a guardian there the whole time and she needs to arrive early Friday and leaving Sunday. We did ask the cheer director if a friends mom could bring her and my husband could meet her there after but they said no. And if she\u2019s not there for the check in time she can\u2019t compete that weekend. \n\nRiley\u2019s prom is Friday. Riley did not have a junior prom and her school only has senior prom. We found out the date of prom after school started and the trip had already been booked and paid for. \n\nMy husband is now going to be missing Riley\u2019s prom to take Lauren to her competition. \n\nRiley thinks this is extremely unfair and that we\u2019re playing favorites since she\u2019ll never get this chance again and she wants pictures with her dad and sister. She\u2019s been messaging my husband about it. \n\nLauren doesn\u2019t want to miss her competition and risk her spot on her team. \n\nMy husband asked if I\u2019d cancel my trip and I told him no. The trip has been booked, paid for, and I also need a break. He takes breaks and trips as well. \n\nMy husband and I are now fighting because he feels like no matter what he does he\u2019s stuck. He\u2019s already told Lauren he\u2019ll be taking her to the cheer comp which means he\u2019ll be missing prom. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nUpdate: \n\nI have decided to stand my ground that I will not be cancelling my trip. I will be getting on the plane in the morning. \n\nJosh just sat down me, Riley, and Lauren to talk about the weekend. He explained he\u2019ll be taking Lauren to her competition while Riley\u2019s mother takes pictures with her at prom. He said he taught the girls about commitment and he\u2019s not going to have Lauren\u2019s absence have the team Forfeit. \n\nHe told her we could do pictures if she wanted to put her dress on a second time but she said it won\u2019t be the same and she\u2019s upset. \n\nRiley is upset with her father and thinks he\u2019s favoring Lauren.",

I remember who I went to prom with, I don't remember the hour at my house beforehand where the parents insisted on taking photos. I know for a fact some of the parents weren't there for the photos, because they had to work or do other stuff. It's prom, not a wedding or a graduation. Prom is about the kids spending time with each other, it's not a family event."

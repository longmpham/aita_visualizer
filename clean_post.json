    "selftext": "NSFW due to mentions of drugs\n\nI am a recovering addict. I used to have xanax prescribed to me for panic attacks but it was discontinued. I kept an old bottle in the cupboard just in case (I know, I know.)\n\nOn Saturday my parents came over. I told them how I was doing in my recovery and that I was going to properly dispose of my old Xanax at the pharmacy or police department. \n\nFor the sake of brevity, she asked me for the drugs and I said No. My No was not respected. When I said no she said \u201cwell why, I\u2019m not an addict!\u201d She then proceeded to rub my nose in the fact that I stole drugs from her when I was in active addiction, and basically said I owed her. \n\nI was so upset, that I brought up a time she medicated me without a doctor\u2019s consent or prescription when I was a child. She then gaslit me, saying I was making it up and that never happened. I kicked her out of my house. \n\nI\u2019m so upset. I\u2019m in very early recovery and trying my hardest to get well. We haven\u2019t spoken since I kicked her out and my heart hurts. I just wanted my mom to be proud of me, but instead she tried to guilt me for my old medication. So Reddit, AITA?\n\n(I disposed of the medicine the next day at the police department). I\u2019m 7 days sober from my drug of choice today.\n\nEdit: I just want to say thank you to everyone for wishing me well in my sobriety. I appreciate all of you and your responses so, so much!\n\nEdit 2: Just wanted to add that I do attend NA meetings daily and have a sponsor, for those concerned about my recovery. And thank you again. I\u2019m crying reading all of these supportive responses.\n\nEdit 3: Dog tax has been posted to my profile",

And especially Xanax isn't candy you can just hand out.\n\nThe fact that you stole meds from her in the past has nothing to do with that. In fact, reconsider how often you see your mother if she's continuously going to bring up your past to get something from you."

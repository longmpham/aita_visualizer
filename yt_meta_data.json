    "description": "would I be the A-Hole if I took my son and his friends out for his birthday instead of my wife and step-daughters?wrote: I (m42) have three kids. A son Isaac (12 almost 13) with my ex who is no longer in the picture and twin step-daughters from my wife\u2019s previous relationship; Emma and Ava (7). \n\nIsaac\u2019s 13th birthday is coming up next week, and he said that he wants to go to the movies, and asked if he could bring two friends along. I agreed, and we planned a day out of fun (arcade, pizza, and a movie). These were all activities that I know that my son and his friends (nerdy middleschool boys) would enjoy. \n\nWhen I told my wife about our plans, she suggested that we should have a family outing instead, and proposed a local kiddy playplace that my step-daughters apparently love. I said that Isaac and his friends would be very disappointed, and that he wouldn\u2019t have fun at the kiddy playplace. \n\nShe tried to convince me that Isaac could still have fun because there was an \u2018arcade\u2019 (two claw machines, a pinball table, and a small DDR machine). She also said that, since he sees his friends at school everyday, family time should be prioritized over friends. \n\nI told her that it was unfair to force Isaac to spend his birthday at a kiddy playplace instead of with his friends. She accused me of favoritism and of not loving my step-daughters as much Isaac. This hit me pretty hard because I grew up with a step-father who neglected me in favor of his own kids, and I\u2019ve been trying my hardest to be the father figure I never had. \n\nI\u2019ve been spiraling down a rabbit hole of doubt about my own choices, and for the sake of my own sanity, WIBTA?",

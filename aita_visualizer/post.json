    "title": "AITA for calling out my mom on social media for abandoning me on my birthday",
    "selftext": "Context: I just turned 21 years old last month and I have spent the last few birthdays by myself due to being in college.  \n\nAbout a month before my birthday, my mom and I are sitting in the living room when she asks me \u201cWhat do you wanna do for your birthday this year?\u201d I told her that it didn\u2019t matter as long as I got to spend it with her, seeing as I was away at college for the last two years. (I took a year off to help with family and to take care of my mental health) A week later, she tells me that she found a VR place that was open for my birthday and made reservations for us to go which I was ecstatic about. She knew how much I loved VR and her making the reservation was a good thing. A few days before my birthday, she calls me from her job and tells me she canceled our reservation to go on a \u201cdate night\u201d with her boyfriend. When I asked her why, she said it was the only day they could get a table for the restaurant. I told her she had made a promise to spend my birthday with me and now she\u2019s breaking it. She then said to get over it and spend the day with my gf. (My gf works for a cruise line and is out of country until July) I ended up spending my birthday alone and made a post on social media calling my mom out for abandoning me on a milestone birthday. My family is now divided. Half are siding with me, and the others are saying I\u2019m selfish and I went too far making the post. I haven\u2019t taken it down yet. So, am I the asshole here?\n\n\nSmall disclaimer: this is a pattern of her\u2019s that has been going on since I was 12. Whether it\u2019s my birthday, a competition, or an important event of mine this always happen. Just thought I\u2019d add a little clarification. And for the people in the comments calling me her daughter, I\u2019m her son. Her only son.",

She also knew so little about you and your GF that she didn't know your GF was away on business.\n\nPeople get away with being complete jerks because everyone else wants to be 'polite' and keep things private.  Calling out a jerk's bad behaviour is causing them embarrassment?  Good.  Family upset because it got pointed out?  Too bad, so sad.",

Maybe she should\u2019ve thought about it first ? \n\nWhat a selfish person, if nothing had been planned in the beginning I could have \u201cunderstand\u201d but she literally planned something and cancelled it for a date ? Is her love life more important that her kids birthday ?? She better not come crying when you don\u2019t invite her to your great life events \u2026",
